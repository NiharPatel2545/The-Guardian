# Pass marks

Written before any model is trained. A detector ships only if it meets every mark on data it never saw during training
or tuning. Misses are published along with the wins.

## Test data rules

- Train, tune and test sets come from **different sources** (different datasets or collections), not a random split of one
  set, so the score reflects attacks the model has not seen.
- Normal text includes hard cases: everyday messages that mention "ignore", "instructions", "system" or "password" in a
  harmless way, security discussions, and code. A guard that flags these interrupts real users.
- The test set is used once per candidate. Anything used to choose a threshold or a model is a tuning set, not a test set.

## Data for v1 (fixed before download, 30 Oct 2026)

| Set | Sources (licence) | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| Train | SPML Chatbot Prompt Injection (MIT); jailbreak-classification train split (Apache-2.0); LLMail-Inject phase-2 labelled submissions, attacks hidden in emails (MIT); Dolly-15k instructions and context passages as normal text (CC BY-SA 3.0) | fitting the model |
| Tune | jailbreak-classification test split (Apache-2.0) | choosing epochs and the threshold only |
| Test (held out, sources never seen in training) | deepset prompt-injections, all splits (Apache-2.0); Lakera Gandalf ignore-instructions (MIT, attacks only); LLMail-Inject emails for false-positive tests (MIT, normal emails) | the marks below, once per candidate |

Prompt Guard 2 is scored on the same test set when access to it is granted (Mark 1 waits for that).

## Marks for the first trained detector (v1)

| # | Mark | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | At no more than 2% false alarms on normal text, catches at least 5 points more attacks than Meta's Prompt Guard 2 (86M) on the same held-out test set | The point of the project: fewer interruptions for the same or better protection |
| 2 | Beats the rules-only `HeuristicDetector` by at least 15 points of catch rate at the same false-alarm rate | Otherwise the model is not worth its weight |
| 3 | No more than 3% false alarms on the hard-normal set | Real users must not be blocked for normal sentences |
| 4 | Under 20 ms per message on the RTX 5070 Ti laptop GPU, under 150 ms on a laptop CPU | It sits in front of every message an agent reads |
| 5 | Results reported per source and per attack type, including every type where it is worse than the baseline | Honest claims only |

## Results

**Baseline, heuristic-v0 (test set):** catches 31.0% of attacks, 0 of 559 normal texts flagged. deepset 5.7%, Gandalf 37.7%.

**v1, ModernBERT-base, 3 epochs (test set, 30 Oct 2026): FAILED marks 1-4.** Catches 71.2% of attacks (deepset 52.1%,
Gandalf 76.2%) but false alarms are 34.3%: all 160 normal emails flagged, 8% of deepset's normal texts. Catch rate at 2%
false alarms: 0. 26 ms per text on the GPU. Cause: every email in the training data was an attack, so the model learned
"email = attack". Tune set (same family as training) looked perfect (99% caught, 1.6% false alarms), which is why the
held-out test matters.

**v2 change (written before v2 ran):** add the 2,500 LLMail-Inject phase-2 emails its judges marked as not attacks to the
training set as normal text, and cap attack emails at 2,500 so emails carry no label signal on their own. Everything else
unchanged. Same test set, scored once.

**v2 result (test set, 30 Oct 2026):** catches 67.2% of attacks with 3.6% false alarms (0 of 160 normal emails, 5.0% of
deepset's normal texts). At 2% false alarms it catches 61.6%, against 31.3% for the heuristic. 24 ms per text on the GPU.
- Mark 1 (vs Prompt Guard 2): not yet scored, needs access to the model.
- Mark 2 (beat the heuristic by 15+ points at the same false-alarm rate): **passed**, +30.3 points.
- Mark 3 (no more than 3% false alarms on hard normal text): **failed narrowly**, 3.6% overall, 5.0% on deepset.
- Mark 4 (under 20 ms per message on the GPU): **failed narrowly**, 24 ms.
- Weakest spot: deepset (44% caught). Part of it is German, and ModernBERT-base is English-only.

The test set has now been used for two candidates. Before v3, add a fresh held-out source so later choices are not tuned to it.

**v3 plan (written 30 Oct 2026, before any v3 data was built or model trained):**
- Base model: mmBERT-base (multilingual ModernBERT, MIT) instead of the English-only ModernBERT-base.
- Training additions: yanismiraoui prompt_injections (Apache-2.0, 7 languages) and neuralchemy Prompt-injection-dataset
  (Apache-2.0). Everything else as v2.
- New **fresh test set**, never used before: ShieldLM prompt-injection test split (MIT, 8 languages) and S-Labs
  prompt-injection test split (MIT). Any text that also appears in training is removed from training.
  Amended before building: ShieldLM is compiled from other datasets, three of which are in our training data and one in
  the old test, so only its rows from other sources are kept (alespalla chatbot prompts, safeguard, harelix mixed
  techniques, in-the-wild jailbreaks, InjecAgent, JailbreakBench). S-Labs does not list its sources, so exact duplicates
  of training text are removed; near-duplicates may remain.
- v3 is judged on the fresh test set (the honest number) and also reported on the old test set for comparison with v2.
- Ship v3 over v2 only if, on the fresh set, its catch rate at 2% false alarms is at least 5 points higher than v2's on the
  same fresh set, and its false alarms at the default threshold are no higher than v2's.

## Marks for the rules half (policy and gateway)

Met by `tests/test_guardian.py` (6 tests): unknown tools blocked, paths cannot escape allowed folders, only listed websites,
forbidden command patterns blocked, approval for "ask" tools, rate and spending caps, kill switch, taint after a suspected
injection, and a full audit log.

**v3 result and comparison (30 Oct 2026, scored once).** Catch rate at 2% false alarms / false alarms at the default threshold:

| | Fresh test (7,601 rows) | Old test (1,822 rows) |
|---|---|---|
| heuristic-v0 | 5.6% / 0.0% | 31.3% / 0.0% |
| v2 | 36.0% / 2.5% | 61.6% / 3.6% |
| v3 | 45.1% / 10.8% | 97.0% / 1.1% |
| ProtectAI deberta-v3 prompt-injection v2 | 83.4% / 0.1% | 91.4% / 0.7% |

- v3 vs v2 on the fresh set: +9.1 points at 2% false alarms (mark: +5, met) but false alarms at the default threshold rose
  from 2.5% to 10.8% (mark: no higher, **failed**). v3 does not replace v2 as the default; its threshold would need raising.
- The industry baseline (ProtectAI) is far ahead on the fresh set: 83% caught at almost no false alarms. Its training data
  is not fully published, so it may have seen some of these sources; the old test likely overlaps its training data, so the
  fresh set is the fairer comparison. Honest position: we are well behind on unseen data.
- Next: more and more varied normal text (v3's false alarms are on everyday chatbot prompts and JailbreakBench's harmless
  requests), and agent-style indirect attacks (InjecAgent 46%, harelix 51%).

**v4 plan (written 30 Oct 2026, before any v4 data was downloaded or model trained):**
- Base model: mmBERT-base, same settings as v3.
- Training additions, normal text: OpenAssistant oasst2 user prompts, all languages (Apache-2.0), up to 15,000; OR-Bench 80k,
  harmless requests that sound risky (CC BY 4.0), up to 15,000; XSTest safe prompts (CC BY 4.0).
- Training additions, attacks: Lakera Mosscap prompt-injection game (MIT), up to 10,000; Lakera Gandalf summarization,
  attacks hidden inside text to summarise (MIT). Gandalf is the same game family as the old test, so the old test gets
  less fair for v4; the fresh set is the one that decides.
- New tune set: 10% of each new source, held out of training, plus the old tune set. The threshold is the one that keeps
  false alarms at 2% or less on the tune set's normal text. The fresh test is not used to choose anything.
- Honest note: the choice of these sources was informed by v3's mistakes on the fresh set (everyday chatbot prompts,
  harmless requests), so the fresh set is now partly seen. v5 needs another never-used test source.
- Ship v4 as the default only if, on the fresh set, (1) its catch rate at 2% false alarms is at least 5 points above v3's
  45.1%, and (2) its false alarms at the chosen threshold are no higher than v2's 2.5%. Reported per source either way.

**v4 result (30 Oct 2026, scored once).** The tune-set threshold came out at 0.5 (2% false alarms on the tune set was already
below 0.5). Catch rate at 2% false alarms / false alarms at the threshold:

| | Fresh test (7,601 rows) | Old test (1,822 rows) |
|---|---|---|
| v2 | 36.0% / 2.5% | 61.6% / 3.6% |
| v3 | 45.1% / 10.8% | 97.0% / 1.1% |
| **v4** | **76.5% / 2.1%** | 89.9% / 0.9% |
| ProtectAI deberta-v3 prompt-injection v2 | 83.4% / 0.1% | 91.4% / 0.7% |

- Ship mark (1) +5 points over v3 at 2% false alarms: **passed**, +31.4. Mark (2) false alarms no higher than v2's 2.5%:
  **passed**, 2.1%. v4 replaces v2 as the default.
- First-model marks: mark 2 (beat the heuristic by 15+): passed. Mark 3 (no more than 3% false alarms on hard normal text):
  passed on both sets (deepset 1.3%, everyday chatbot prompts 2.1%). Mark 4 (under 20 ms on the GPU): passed, 14.7 ms. Mark 1
  (Prompt Guard 2) still not scored.
- Per source on the fresh set: S-Labs 84.9% caught / 1.4% false alarms, safeguard 87.8% / 2.4%, in-the-wild jailbreaks 92.0%,
  JailbreakBench harmless requests 18.5% false alarms (5 of 27).
- **Worse than v3 on agent attacks**: InjecAgent 21.5% caught, harelix mixed techniques 21.9%. Attacks hidden in tool output
  are the weak spot. Old-test deepset dropped to 35% (part German).
- Still 7 points behind ProtectAI on the fresh set, with more false alarms (2.1% vs 0.1%). The fresh set was partly seen when
  choosing v4's data (see the v4 plan), so treat 76.5% as an upper bound until a never-used test source is scored.
